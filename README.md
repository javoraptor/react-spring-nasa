# NASA Rover Image App

React/boot application to fetch rover images based on search criteria or file provide.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need and IDE of choice, STS was used for this project, and node for front end development.

The NASA API used requires a private API key for continuous use. This project used the default public API key that the API provides but is limited to n number of calls per day. You may provide a private key through a server param such as -Dprivatekey=<privateKey>


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Install react dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Install boot dependencies (this will vary on IDE, STS downloads automatically when project is added)

```
STS -> right click project and select -> gradle refresh 
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Code Changes

Start front end server:

```
yarn start
```

Start spring boot app in IDE (command will vary depending on IDE)

```
alt+shift+x, b
```

In your web browser of choice navigate to http://localhost:9090/ in order to view app. 

## Testing

Explain tests used, controller, service ect...

### Unit Tests Execution

To execute tests:

```
gradle test
```

## Code Analysis

PMD Analysis: 

```
gradle check
```

Jacoco Analysis:

```
gradle test jacocoTestReport
```


Sonar Analysis:

```
./gradlew sonarqube \
  -Dsonar.organization=javoraptor-github \
  -Dsonar.host.url=https://sonarcloud.io \
  -Dsonar.login=<private>
```

## Deployment

If deploying application as is you can leverage the gradle wrapper:

In order to deploy application all final react files need to be included into src/main/resources. This will download any dependencies needed and start the embedded Tomcat server that will be listening for request on port 9090:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

If changes to the front end have been made you will have to incorporate those changes into the spring boot app by doing the following tasks:

Build react application:

```
yarn build
```

Build jar:

```
gradle copyReactBuild build
```

You can now execute the jar located under build/libs. If you would like to use the wrapper then only (gradle copyReactBuild) is needed before executing (./gradlew bootRun)

## Highlights

* Caching: Fixed rate of 6 hours, can be changed in config file
* Async Rest: WIP on async branch

## Future Enhancements
* React JEST Test Suite
* React Logging, configure log server (track.js)
* Add JS Linter
* Wrap Controller response in ResponseDTO to better communicate success/failures with client.
